# User Management System

This User Management System is a Java-based web application designed for managing user data effectively. It allows us to register and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on user entries, making it easy to add new users, edit existing information, and delete users as needed.

## Key Features

1. **User Registration**: Administrators can create new user accounts by entering necessary details such as name, email, and DOB,city etc.
2. **Edit User Details**: Administrators can modify the information of existing users, ensuring that all data is accurate and up-to-date.
3. **Delete Users**: Users can be removed from the system when they are no longer needed.
4. **View User List**: The application displays a list of all registered users, allowing easy management of user accounts.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Java (using Servlets for server-side logic and JDBC for database connectivity)
- **Frontend**: Dynamic HTML generated by Servlets (styled with Bootstrap for a responsive design)
- **Database**: MySQL

This application provides a simple and effective interface for managing user information.
